_HTML and CSS Layout homework_

Today's project was a lesson in how css interacts with html. What you see in the project is using css to manipulate html to look like another project. We were not allowed to manipulate the html though. 

What you should see are 3 octocat pictures in a row with a boder around the image, some text and images below each border box, and a line under that text.
